		<h1>My Thoughts on the Internet</h1>
		<h3>The Internet is Not Secure</h3>
		<p>To be honest, the current state of internet privacy and security is a joke. A lot of websites nowadays require you to create an 
		account, which I think is stupid. The more you think about it, the more you can see how useless online accounts are. Even with websites like 
		Amazon, Ebay, or any other online retailer for that matter, having accounts are pointless. What would you rather do, buy everything without 
		an online account and stay semi-anonymous, or give Amazon your personal info to make things "easier to use". By trusting these online sites 
		with your personal information you are creating your own security risk. I honestly think that all online retailers should have a "checkout as 
		guest" option no matter what. Not only that, but some websites don't even secure your password and personal info correctly. This can lead to
		thousands of people's personal info being stolen, not good.</p>
		<p>Internet security is one thing, but internet privacy is way worse currently. If you're apart of the majority of the population and you use 
		Windows with Chrome, as well as the Google search engine, then congrats, you're being spied on. All three of those items I just mentioned are 
		closed source programs that sell your personal info for money $$$. And yes, WINDOWS SPIES ON YOU, in case you were wondering. Same goes for a 
		lot of websites on the internet like Google, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and etc. However, you can avoid this, you can stop or mitigate 
		the spying done on you. You can install a free/open source OS like Linux or BSD and you can find alternative search engines as well as installing 
		a web browser that respects your privacy like Brave, LibreWolf, or really anything besides Chrome and Edge. Only you can help stop the mass 
		serveillance on the internet by using free and open source software.</p>
		<h3>The Internet is Bloated</h3>
		<p>The internet is way too bloated and slow.</p>
		<h3>The Internet is Censored</h3>
		<h3>Can the Internet be Fixed?</h3>
