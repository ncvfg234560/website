                <h1>My Thoughts on Social Media</h1>
                <h3>Cancel Culture is dumb</h3>
                <p>I think that cancel culture is completely and udderly stupid. Cancel culture is basically just
                modern day witch hunts. And the dumbest thing about it, is that nobody does anything about it until
                it affects them in some way.</p>
                <p>The first time this really happened (at least from my view) was when people on Twitter had an outrage about
                James Gunn's tweets from years ago. For those of you who don't know who James Gunn is, he directed the Guardians
                of the Galaxy and also helped produce other movies like Avengers: Infinity War. Basically, people found some jokes
                on Twitter that he made yaers ago and decided to "cancel" him. But the thing is, the jokes didn't really have that
                much wrong with them. I mean, the humor was a bit taboo, but I don't really see what was wrong with them. In fact, I
                thought that his jokes were pretty funny. Anyways, after this happened, he actually got fired from Marvel Studios/Disney,
                which is a dumb move on Marvel/Disney's behalf (why should the internet determine who you hire and fire).</p>
                <p>I think this just goes to show out of hand this has gotten. You could actually get fired for what you say on
                the internet.</p>
