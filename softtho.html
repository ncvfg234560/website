                <h1>My Thoughts on Software</h1>
                <h3>Software should be free and open source</h3>
                <p>The best software is free software. Not free as in free beer, but free as in freedom. If the software you're using
                on your computer is free, then you control your computer. But, if the software on your computer or other devices is not
                free, then your computer controls you. <a href="https://stallman.org"/>Richard Stallman</a>, the founder of the GNU
                project as well as the FSF (Free Software Foundation), makes plenty of excellent points in <a href="https://www.fsf.org/blogs/rms/20140407-geneva-tedx-talk-free-software-free-society">in this video</a>.
                There are more speeches available <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/speeches-and-interview.html">here</a> if you are interested.</p>
                <p><b>If you care about your freedom, you should use free software.</b></p>
                <h3>The current state of software companies</h3>
                <h3>Why you should not support these software companies</h3>
