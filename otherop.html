		<h1>Other Opinions</h1>
		<h3>What I Think About Different Programming Languages</h3>
		<h4>C</h4>
		<p>My personal favorite programming language. C is at a low enough level where programs are lightning fast, 
		but it's also at a high enough level where it's pretty easy to get into and use. Although there have been 
		languages that have come close to it, I don't think any other language can surpass C.</p>
		<h4>C++</h4>
		<p>C++ is very simular to C but has a few differences. C++ has a lot more features than C but that also 
		means that the speed is slower. It's good if you want a speed advantage over other languages (except C), but 
		what a lot of features that most modern languages offer.</p>
		<h4>C#</h4>
		<p>C# is the outcast compared to C and C++. In my opinion, C# is closer to Java than C. 
		It does have some useful purposes and can be useful, but it's mostly directed towards Windows, 
		and if you know me then you know that I don't like Windows.</p>
		<h4>Java</h4>
		<p>Java was a very useful language. Keyword, <b>WAS</b>. Back in the early 2010's and late 2000's Java was 
		the king of programming language because of the fact that it could be used on almost any machine that could 
		run the Java Runtime Enviroment. However, times have changed and Java isn't as useful as it used to be. 
		Java still has it's uses, but I think that it's a dying language.</p>
		<h4>JavaScript</h4>
		<p>I personally dislike Javascript. It has weird syntax, it's not useful for anything outside the web/internet, 
		and it's somewhat slow. Not only that, but some websites using javascript can do some pretty spooky things on your 
		computer like find detailed info on your device (What hardware you're using), track you across websites, and it can 
		even grab your IP address through Tor!</p>
		<h4>R</h4>
		<p>R does one thing, and it does it really well. R is mostly used for statistics, data/data visualization, and etc. 
		If you need a language for those specific things, then R is your saving grace.</p>
		<h4>PHP</h4>
		<p>PHP is used almost exclusively for building websites. It's very useful for communicating between databases and 
		the website itself but does not surve much use outside of that since HTML is way better for creating the frontend of 
		any website. It does have it's uses though and is still very, very useful.</p>
		<h4>HTML/CSS</h4>
		<p>HTML(5) and CSS are the go to standard for creating websites. Almost any website you visit nowadays uses HTML and CSS 
		(or a varient of CSS). It's also great at making simple documents. Very Good ðŸ‘Œ.</p>
		<h4>Python</h4>
		<p>Python is a very good language for beginners and people who want an "easy" language. However, to put it bluntly, 
		Python sucks. Not only is it one of the slowest languages I know (more than 100 times slower than C some cases), but 
		it doesn't even specalize like how R or HTML specializes. If you want to learn programming easily, start with Python, 
		but make sure to move on to something else as soon as you feel confident.</p>
		<h4>Assembly</h4>
		<p>The speed demon of all languages. If you you thought that C was fast, then prepare yourself because Assembly is wayyyyyy faster. 
		But being literally the fastest language ever created comes with its draw backs, it's extremely difficult to learn and use. Assembly 
		is very time consuming and requires the memorization of hundreds of assembly instructions. It is not for the faint of heart. If you need 
		speed over anything else, use assembly.</p>
		<h4>HolyC</h4>
		<p>HolyC is a gift from God. Created by Terry A. Davis, it is perhaps the holy grail of programming languages. It is a mix of C and C++ and 
		is perhaps the best programming language on the plant. Jokes aside, it's a pretty good language for being a compromise between C and C++.</p>
